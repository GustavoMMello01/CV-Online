                    <p class="description">I am a fourth year undergraduate student at FACENS in
                        Computer Engineering, an area that combines technology
                        and my passion for innovation. At FACENS, I participated in
                        opportunities to explore the world, participating in startup
                        competitions, Open Source groups, participating in
                        Scientific Initiations focusing on data analysis with Python
                        and as a scholarship student in Catalonia, Spain in 2020.
                        I am currently doing an internship as a software developer,
                        working with C#, Blazor, WPF and Python in the Fraunhofer
                        Institute in the city of Aachen, Germany. I am also an alumni
                        for Facens at Babson University's Collaborative Student
                        Network and I am a member of the GDG (Google Developers
                        Groups) in my hometown of Sorocaba.</p>
